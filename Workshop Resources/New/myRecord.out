starting Simple Print (CUDA Dynamic Parallelism)
Running on GPU 0 (Tesla K40c)
***************************************************************************
The CPU launches 2 blocks of 2 threads each. On the device each thread will
launch 2 blocks of 2 threads each. The GPU we will do that recursively
until it reaches max_depth=2

In total 2+8=10 blocks are launched!!! (8 from the GPU)
